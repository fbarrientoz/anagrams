This solution will make use of the fact even thoug s1 and s2 are different, they are anagrams only if the consist of exactly the same characters.

We send the words in variable word1 and word2
def isAnagram(word1, word2):
  //We asign the value to s1 and s2 and then we sort, in python we can use the buily-in sort method on lists by symply converting each string to a list at the start.
    s1 = list(word1)
    
    s1.sort()
    s2 = list(word2)
    s2.sort()

We compare s1 and s2 and return true or false.
    return (s1 == s2)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    word1 = "fabiola"
    word2 = "aloibaf"
    valAnagram = isAnagram(word1, word2)

    print("%s | %s | Are anagrams? [ %s ]" % (word1, word2, valAnagram))
